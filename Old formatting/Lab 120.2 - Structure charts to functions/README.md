# Lab 1 - Structure charts to functions
## Overview
In this lab, you will implement a Python program that calculates the area and volume of different shapes using functions. You will be provided with a structure chart, which breaks the program into modular subroutines. Your task is to translate this chart into Python functions.

By the end of this lab, you will understand how to:
- Read and interpret a structure chart.
- Write Python functions with parameters and return values.
- Use modular programming to build a structured application.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this lab, you will:
- Implement functions in Python based on a structure chart.
- Use parameters and return values to pass data between functions.
- Develop a menu-driven program to allow user interaction.
- Apply top-down design by structuring the program into smaller sub-problems.

## Task Instructions

### Step 1: Structure chart
- Use the starter code in lab01_functions.py to create a structure chart for the program.
- Upload your structure chart to your forked GitHub repository
### Step 2: Implement the missing functions
- Complete each of the functions to calculate area and volume.
### Step 3: Test your functions
- Run the program and choose different shapes.
- Verify that the correct area or volume is displayed.
### Step 4: Extend the program
- Edit your structure chart to include an option for calculating the perimeter of suitable shapes.
- Modify your code to include this function.
- Add a loop to allow multiple calculations without restarting the program. 
- Add error handling for invalid inputs.
